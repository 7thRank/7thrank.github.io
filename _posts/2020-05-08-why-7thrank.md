title:  "Why 7thRank?"
---
In the game of Chess a rook on the seventh rank (the opponent’s second rank) is typically very powerful, as it threatens the opponent’s unadvanced pawns and hems in the enemy king. I, therefore, chose `7th Rank Ventures` to symbolize a company capable of far-reaching and powerful endeavors.
